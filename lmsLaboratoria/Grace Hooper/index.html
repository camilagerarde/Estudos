            <p> <strong>Grace Brewster Murray Hopper</strong> ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%A9e" 
                target="_blank" >née</a> Murray December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American computer 
                scientist and United States Navy rear admiral.[1] One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark 
                I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first linkers. 
                She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development 
                of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today.</p>
            <p>Prior to joining the Navy, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale University and was 
                a professor of mathematics at Vassar College. Hopper attempted to enlist in the Navy during 
                World War II but was rejected because she was 34 years old. She instead joined the Navy 
                Reserves. Hopper began her computing career in 1944 when she worked on the Harvard Mark I 
                team led by Howard H. Aiken. In 1949, she joined the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation 
                and was part of the team that developed the UNIVAC I computer. At Eckert–Mauchly she began 
                developing the compiler. She believed that a programming language based on English was 
                possible. Her compiler converted English terms into machine code understood by computers. 
                By 1952, Hopper had finished her program linker (originally called a compiler), which was 
                written for the A-0 System.[2][3][4][5] During her wartime service, she co-authored three 
                papers based on her work on the Harvard Mark 1.</p>
            <p>In 1954, Eckert–Mauchly chose Hopper to lead their department for automatic programming, and she led 
                the release of some of the first compiled languages like FLOW-MATIC. In 1959, she participated in the 
                CODASYL consortium, which consulted Hopper to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming
                 language. This led to the COBOL language, which was inspired by her idea of a language being based on
                  English words. In 1966, she retired from the Naval Reserve, but in 1967 the Navy recalled her to 
                  active duty. She retired from the Navy in 1986 and found work as a consultant for the Digital 
                  Equipment Corporation, sharing her computing experiences.</p>
            <p>The U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Hopper was named for her, as was the Cray 
                XE6 "Hopper" supercomputer at NERSC.[6] During her lifetime, Hopper was awarded 40 honorary degrees from 
                universities across the world. A college at Yale University was renamed in her honor. In 1991, she 
                received the National Medal of Technology. On November 22, 2016, she was posthumously awarded the 
                Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.[7]</p>
